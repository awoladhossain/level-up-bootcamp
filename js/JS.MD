## Promises in JavaScript: A Detailed and Easy Explanation
A Promise is like a "promise" in real life. Imagine you order food online. You don't know exactly when it will arrive, but you know that:

1.If the food arrives (fulfilled): You'll eat it.
2.If the food doesn't arrive (rejected): You'll be disappointed and maybe complain.
In JavaScript, a Promise is a way to handle asynchronous operations (tasks that take time, like fetching data from a server) without getting stuck waiting for them to finish.
