# Level Up Bootcamp

Welcome to my **Level Up Bootcamp** journey! This repository documents my learning, projects, and notes as I enhance my skills in modern web development, server-side programming, and data structures and algorithms (DSA).

## Goals
By the end of this bootcamp, I aim to:
- Master frontend and backend technologies.
- Build scalable and efficient applications.
- Enhance problem-solving skills in DSA and algorithms.
- Get hands-on experience with tools and frameworks essential for modern development.

## Topics Covered

### Frontend
- **React**: Build interactive and dynamic web interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management for scalable applications.
- **TypeScript**: Writing safer and more robust JavaScript code.
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Build scalable server-side applications.
- **NestJS**: Framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **Prisma**: Modern ORM for database management.

### Databases
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for document-based data.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured data.

### DevOps
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments and deployments.

### Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Python**: Solve problems and practice algorithmic thinking.
- **DSA and Algorithms**: Focus on problem-solving techniques and efficiency.
